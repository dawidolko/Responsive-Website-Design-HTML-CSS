# Curiosities Magazine

> 📰 **Sixteen pages, no JavaScript** — a fully responsive magazine and shop template built with HTML and CSS alone

**Curiosities Magazine** is a website template for a magazine that also sells: home, articles, three product pages with their own checkout screens, gallery, services, about, FAQ, contact and privacy — sixteen pages in all. Every layout, every hover state and every breakpoint is CSS. There is no JavaScript anywhere in the project, which was the constraint it was built under.

It was produced for an internet technologies course and carries the evidence: W3C validation, responsiveness testing across viewports, a SEO report and KSS-style documentation of the stylesheets, all written up in this repository.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **No JavaScript at all** — the menu, the galleries and the interactive states are CSS. The site works with scripting disabled because there is nothing to disable.
- **Sixteen pages, one visual language** — each page gets its own stylesheet (`styleIndex.css`, `styleGallery.css`, `stylePay.css` …), so page-specific rules cannot leak into a neighbour.
- **A full purchase path** — three product pages, each with its own checkout screen, plus a shared payment page. The flow is complete rather than stopping at "add to cart".
- **Forms with HTML validation** — contact and payment use the browser's own constraint validation: required fields, types and patterns, no script needed.
- **Responsive without a framework** — tested across desktop, tablet and phone viewports with no horizontal scrolling and no clipped edges; the report is in this repository.
- **Semantic markup for SEO** — proper heading order, meta tags and landmark elements, with the SEO report included.
- **Documented stylesheets** — KSS-style comments describe the components, so the template can be modified without reverse-engineering the CSS.
- **W3C validated** — both the markup and the stylesheets pass validation.
